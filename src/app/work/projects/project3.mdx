## Overview

In many universities and schools, students and teachers struggle to find a single space where they can share events, collaborate on scientific projects, and discover learning opportunities. They juggle group chats, scattered websites, and disconnected email lists—missing deadlines and losing the spark of innovation. To bridge these gaps, I created **Clubster**, a unified platform that blends social networking with academic tools, driven by a powerful AI assistant.

Clubster brings together students, institutes, teachers, and science clubs in one intuitive environment. Users can host or join workshops, register for scientific events, form project teams, and showcase their club’s achievements. Integrating AI enables personalized learning suggestions, opportunity alerts, and team-matching recommendations—turning Clubster into both a hub and a mentor for every academic venture.

## Key Features

- **Scientific Event Hub**  
  Organize and browse conferences, hackathons, webinars, and workshops. Automated scheduling, registration tracking, and real-time updates keep everyone on the same page.
- **Team & Project Collaboration**  
  Create dedicated workspaces for research groups and club projects. Share documents, assign tasks, and track milestones with built-in Kanban boards and version control.
- **AI Learning Assistant**  
  Our integrated AI analyzes each student’s activity and suggests courses, articles, and team opportunities. It notifies users of relevant scholarships, competitions, and research calls—so no chance slips by.
- **Club Showcase & Networking**  
  Scientific clubs can pitch their missions, publish project portfolios, and recruit new members. A dynamic feed highlights top innovations and trending collaborations.
- **Opportunity Alerts**  
  Receive instant notifications for upcoming grant deadlines, national competitions, and internship openings—customized to your field of study and past engagements.
- **Multilingual & Accessible**  
  Supports English, Arabic, and French interfaces, ensuring smooth adoption across diverse academic communities.

## Technologies Used

- **React & Next.js**: Crafted a responsive, SEO-friendly front end for seamless navigation across devices.  
- **Express.js & Node.js**: Powered the RESTful API and real-time WebSocket channels for chat, notifications, and live collaboration.  
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Managed user profiles, event data, and project repositories in a scalable, secure NoSQL database.  
- **TensorFlow.js**: Enabled client-side AI models for personalized learning recommendations without compromising privacy.  
- **Socket.io**: Facilitated instant messaging, team chatrooms, and live event updates.  
- **i18next**: Handled multilingual support, making it easy to switch languages on the fly.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a social-academic platform with real-time collaboration and AI guidance was no small feat. Synchronizing live chats, event updates, and project boards required careful event-driven architecture to avoid race conditions. Training and deploying AI models in the browser posed performance constraints—optimizing model size and inference paths was crucial to maintain a smooth user experience.

Integrating multilingual support early on meant rethinking UI components for dynamic text expansion and right-to-left layouts. Frequent usability tests with students and faculty helped us catch localization quirks before launch. These iterations reinforced the value of continuous feedback and modular design.

## Outcome

After months of development and pilot programs at several institutions, Clubster’s impact was clear:

- **User Engagement** skyrocketed, with over 1,200 active student profiles and 45 scientific clubs onboarded in the first quarter.
- **Collaboration Efficiency** improved by 60%, as teams used our Kanban workflows and AI suggestions to hit project milestones faster.
- **Opportunity Capture** increased dramatically; students reported discovering 3× more competitions and grants via Clubster alerts than through traditional channels.

My dedication to this vision was recognized at the **National AI Startups Competition 2024** in Tebessa University, where Clubster received a special honor. In 2025, I won **2nd place** at the **National Universities Competition for Best Startup Idea** in Constantine—where I had the privilege of meeting the city’s mayor. These awards are a testament to how technology, when thoughtfully applied, can push educational innovation to its limits.

This journey with Clubster has been both challenging and rewarding—fueling my passion to keep reimagining how students learn, connect, and innovate together.
